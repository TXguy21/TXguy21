### **Projects & Hands-On Experience**

This section showcases my practical application of cybersecurity principles and technical skills. Click on the links to explore the detailed reports and artifacts.

#### **Security Audit and Risk Management**
* **Project:** [Botium Toys Security Audit and Risk Assessment](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z1PP59sWQ9yF8zYlDaP6MkfVrem4_fl0DthxTy6tW4Y/edit?tab=t.0)
* **Report:** [Botium Toys Scope, Goals, and Risk Assessment Report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z1PP59sWQ9yF8zYlDaP6MkfVrem4_fl0DthxTy6tW4Y/edit?tab=t.0)
  * *Description:* Conducted a comprehensive security audit and risk assessment for a fictional company, identifying critical vulnerabilities and non-compliance issues. Developed actionable recommendations for implementing essential security controls (e.g., access controls, encryption, disaster recovery) and achieving compliance with PCI DSS, GDPR, and SOC frameworks.

#### **Network Traffic Monitoring and Attack Detection Lab**
* **Project:** [Analyzing Network Layer Communication Project Report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z1PP59sWQ9yF8zYlDaP6MkfVrem4_fl0DthxTy6tW4Y/edit?tab=t.0)
* **Activity:** [Analyze Network Layer Communication Screenshot](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z1PP59sWQ9yF8zYlDaP6MkfVrem4_fl0DthxTy6tW4Y/edit?tab=t.0)
  * *Description:* Performed network traffic analysis using simulated logs to detect and analyze an incident involving unreachable DNS services. Identified root causes, interpreted ICMP and UDP protocol behavior, and documented findings in a cybersecurity incident report. This project simulated key functions of a Security Operations Center (SOC), requiring me to analyze raw log data, similar to how a SIEM aggregates information, to detect anomalies and articulate potential threats.

#### **Personal IT Infrastructure Management & Troubleshooting**
* *Description:* Designed and built a custom high-performance PC (Ryzen 5 7600x, AMD 9070, ROG STRIX B650-a, 32GB RAM, 6TB SSD). Continuously manage, troubleshoot, and secure the system, including network configurations (Wi-Fi/Bluetooth), firewall rules, driver updates, and system software hardening. This demonstrates practical system administration and endpoint security skills.
